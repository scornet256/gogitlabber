# GoGitlabber

This project is inspired from the python application called gitlabber (https://github.com/ezbz/gitlabber).
It is mainly to learn Golang. But also to make something that specifically solves my problem. ðŸ˜†

It is definitely not as feature-rich as the original project... ðŸ˜¬

The program can clone and pull all repositories you have access to on a selfhosted or SaaS provided Gitlab or Gitea
server.
It only supports the HTTP access method.

It will pull the repositories in a tree like structure same as on Gitlab or Gitea.

```
root [http://gitlab.example.com]
â”œâ”€â”€ group1 [/group1]
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ subgroup1 [/group1/subgroup1]
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ project1 [/group1/subgroup1/project1]
â””â”€â”€ group2 [/group2]
    â”œâ”€â”€ subgroup1 [/group2/subgroup1]
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ project2 [/group2/subgroup1/project2]
    â”œâ”€â”€ subgroup2 [/group2/subgroup2]
    â””â”€â”€ subgroup3 [/group2/subgroup3]
```
